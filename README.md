# Epicara - Visual Novel Engine for DDevs Buildathon

This engine reads and processes novel chapters, creating interactive elements from dialogues -- all through Discord as Message Embeds!
It can be run as a Discord bot if you have the token (create a config.json or .env to authenticate) and it will allow you to use `/startvn` slash command.

Please note that this is the simplest form for short kinetic visual novels. See chapters/chapter-01.json for the format.

Other features like branching paths, multiple endings, etc. are not included. Feel free to contribute if you like!
